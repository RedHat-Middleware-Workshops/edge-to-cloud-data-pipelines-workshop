= Defining, Deploying, and Testing The Pricing Engine

== Overview
In this section you will investigate the existing pricing engine, deploy it, and then test it.  The pricing service aka *camel-price* service was introduced in an earlier section for this lab.

The approach taken in this lab is to implement a simple pricing engine using Red Hat CamelK, which is a lightweight cloud native integration and data transformation technology. It is one of the main implementations of the upstream Camel project.  It provides developers with over 200 pre-built connectors to message brokers, databases, etc.. One also has the ability to quickly implement REST services, and manipulate data packets and protocol headers in powerful ways.

Red Hat CamelK implements these capabilities as "Routes," which can be written in most modern programming languages and also as xml and yaml syntax.  Red Hat is also investigating visual editors such as Kaoto to build routes.

== Launching the DevSpaces Environment
As mentioned in the Overview for the Lab, each user will need to use the Browser based IDE Red Hat DevSpaces. 

Click the link below to provision your exercise in DevSpaces:

NOTE: The launcher below will open in a new browser tab


* https://devspaces.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/edge-to-cloud-data-pipelines-workshop/main/devfile.yaml[Launch Lab in _DevSpaces_,role=resource,window=_blank]




// Use the following steps to open a new DevSpaces instance and create a workspace for the lab github project.
// * Locate and Click on the DevSpaces menu item in OpenShift

Then follow the steps behind to onboard into DevSpaces.

* Click on the *Log in with OpenShift* button

== Reviewing The Current Pricing Engine

You should by now ready to work on your DevSpaces development environment.

* You should see several files in the folder view, and we will soon be working with them.
+

{empty} +

* You now need to create a command terminal to enter commands
** Click on the hamburger menu on the Left side of the DevSpace window, and continue to click on the unfolding menus to create a terminal window.
** The screenshot below shows the sequence of steps
+
[.bordershadow]

// ** Option 2 for opening a new terminal.
// +
// [.bordershadow]
// image::02-05/camel-price/04-create-terminal2.png[width=75%]

// {empty} +

* You should see a terminal window open in the bottom portion of the screen.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/04.1-terminal-view.png[width=75%]

{empty} +

* Execute the command below to move to the `price-engine` directory:
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
cd /projects/lab-2/price-engine
+
[NOTE]
--
you may get prompted to allow text to be copied into the cliboard, click *Allow*.

{empty} +

// * Confirm you are in the correct directory by entering *pwd* and hitting return/enter at the command prompt.
// +
// [.bordershadow]
// image::02-05/camel-price/04.2-confirm-pwd-prj.png[width=75%]

// {empty} +

* Create a new project (namespace) to work on an empty and clean target:
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
oc new-project {user}-lab2-extra
+
You should see in the output a line similar to:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/05-extra-prj.png[width=75%]
[subs=attributes+]
+
{empty} 

// ** Make sure to hit Enter afterwards
// +
// [.bordershadow]
// image::02-05/camel-price/07-moveto-user-project.png[width=75%]

// {empty} +


// * Another view of the terminal
// +
// [.bordershadow]
// image::02-05/camel-price/05-oc-project-terminal.png[width=75%]

// {empty} +

* We will now review the main files that makeup the *camel-price* service
+
--
** *catalogue.json* acts a simple listing of products and prices that is read by the CamelK route.  It will be converted into an OpenShift ConfigMap resource.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/06-catalogue.png[width=75%]

** *main.xml* contains the main _Camel K_ service definition. It exposes a REST endpoint that the shopping service can call to look up a price on a product identified by the model server. It's implemented as an xml Camel Route.
+

+
[NOTE]
--
Of less relevance, but if you feel curious, also look at:

** *main-helpers.xml* contains other necessary Camel routes, for example, to read the catalogue listing and load it into memory.
--

{empty} +

* You will be copying and pasting some multi-line commands.
+
The first time you do this you may be asked to confirm this.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/08-copy-paste-warning-lines.png[width=75%]

{empty} +

* Copy the following command in the terminal window and hit Return/Enter to run it.  This will take the catalogue file and convert it into a ConfigMap.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
oc create cm catalogue --from-file=catalogue.json
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/09-create-cm-price.png[width=75%]

{empty} +

*  Now you can copy the following command to load and run the CamelK route in the OpenShift {user}-lab2-edge project
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
kamel run *.xml --name price-engine \
--resource configmap:catalogue@/deployments/config
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10-kamel-run-price-engine.png[width=100%]

{empty} +

* Now you test the pricing engine directly by running a Curl command in the terminal window.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
curl \
-H "item: tea-lemon" \
http://price-engine.{user}-lab2-extra.svc:80/price | jq
+
NOTE: the command above pipes the output to `JQ` for a pretty-print JSON rendering.
+
You should see output such as the following.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10.1-return-curl-price-engine.png[width=100%]

{empty} +

* At this point you can back up to the browser tabs and click on the OpenShift Console tab to view the project with the price-engine running as a service.
