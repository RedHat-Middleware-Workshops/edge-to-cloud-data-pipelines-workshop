= Defining, Deploying, and Testing The Pricing Engine

NOTE: This is an *OPTIONAL* section, but recommended for the highly caffeinated students, or dev and ops players looking to dive into inner loop applications services enablement on OpenShift.

== Overview
In this section you will investigate the existing pricing engine, deploy it, and then test it.  The pricing service aka *camel-price* service was introduced in an earlier section for this lab.

The approach taken in this lab is to implement a simple pricing engine using Red Hat CamelK, which is a lightweight cloud native integration and data transformation technology. It is one of the main implementations of the upstream Camel project.  It provides developers with over 200 pre-built connectors to message brokers, databases, etc.. One also has the ability to quickly implement REST services, and manipulate data packets and protocol headers in powerful ways.

Red Hat Camel K implements these capabilities as "Routes," which can be written in most modern programming languages and also as xml and yaml syntax.  Red Hat is also investigating visual editors such as Kaoto to build routes.

== Reviewing The Current Pricing Engine

You should by now be ready to work on your DevSpaces development environment.

* You should see several files in the folder view, and we will soon be working with them.
+

{empty} +

* You now need to create a command terminal to enter commands
** Click on the hamburger menu on the Left side of the DevSpace window, and continue to click on the unfolding menus to create a terminal window.
** The screenshot below shows the sequence of steps.
+
[.bordershadow]

{empty} +


* You should see a terminal window open in the bottom portion of the screen.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/04.1-terminal-view.png[width=75%]

{empty} +

* Execute the command below to move to the `price-engine` directory:
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
cd /projects/lab-2/price-engine
+
[NOTE]
--
you may get prompted to allow text to be copied into the cliboard, click *Allow*.

[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/06-copy-paste-permission.png[width=75%]
--
+
{empty} +


* Create a new project (namespace) to work on an empty and clean target:
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
oc new-project {user}-lab2-extra
+
You should see in the output a line similar to:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/05-extra-prj.png[width=75%]
[subs=attributes+]
+
{empty} 


* We will now review the main files that makeup the *camel-price* service
+
--
** *catalogue.json* acts a simple listing of products and prices that is read by the Camel K route.  It will be converted into an OpenShift ConfigMap resource.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/06-catalogue.png[width=75%]

** *main.xml* contains the main _Camel K_ service definition. It exposes a REST endpoint that the shopping service can call to look up a price on a product identified by the model server. It's implemented as an xml Camel Route.
+

+
[NOTE]
--
Of less relevance, but if you feel curious, also look at:

** *main-helpers.xml* contains other necessary Camel routes, for example, to read the catalogue listing and load it into memory.
--

{empty} +

* In some of the following steps, you will be copying and pasting some multi-line commands.
+
The first time you do this you may be asked to confirm this.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/08-copy-paste-warning-lines.png[width=50%]

{empty} +

* Copy the following command in the terminal window and hit Return/Enter to run it.  This will take the catalogue file and convert it into a ConfigMap.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
oc create cm catalogue --from-file=catalogue.json
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/09-create-cm-price.png[width=75%]

{empty} +

*  Now you can copy the following command to load and run the Camel K route in the OpenShift {user}-lab2-edge project
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
kamel run *.xml --name price-engine \
--resource configmap:catalogue@/deployments/config
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10-kamel-run-price-engine.png[width=100%]

{empty} +

* Since we are working in a terminal, let's give a nod to command line heros who prefer this approach as opposed to all gui based approaches.  Let's look at a couple more things the *kamel* cli can do for us.
** Copy/Paste the following command to get a listing of our currently running Camel K services.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
kamel get
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10.0.1-kamel-run-price-engine.png[width=100%]

{empty} +

* Now you can test the pricing engine directly by running a Curl command in the terminal window.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
curl \
-H "item: tea-lemon" \
http://price-engine.{user}-lab2-extra.svc:80/price | jq
+
NOTE: the command above pipes the output to `JQ` for a pretty-print JSON rendering.
+
You should see output such as the following.
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10.1-return-curl-price-engine.png[width=100%]

{empty} +

* Let's take another look at what the cli can provide us in our inner loop environment. Copy/Paste the following command to get a view of the logs for the container our Camel K service is running inside.
+
[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
kamel logs price-engine
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02-05/camel-price/10.2-kamel-run-price-engine.png[width=100%]

* From a GUI perspective, you can back up to the browser tabs and click on the OpenShift Console tab to view the project with the price-engine running as a service.

== Summary

This Optional Exercise was intended to give you a peak into how developers can rapidly build out services in an OpenShift environment, and perform this from an inner loop standpoint.  OpenShift provides the DevSpaces IDE, which is hosted as a containerized capability on OpenShift.  From a developer perspective, it runs as a web browser based IDE.  This allows developers to login in and quickly run a defined organizationally compliant environment that enables a developer to quickly develop, deploy, and test cloud native micro services on OpenShift. This can be further extended through CI/CD approaches incorporating git repositories, pipelines, and GitOps.  In this exercise we looked at this through the lens of Camel K, a rich cloud native programming approach that can provide key application service capabilities. For example, in this lab Edge based development can include integrating with AI/ML deployed model servers, data sources, and client facing applications.  Ask your lab instructors if you want to learn more about Red Hat's approach to providing a powerful application platform through OpenShift.
